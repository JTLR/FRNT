## Getting started

To get started simply clone the repository or download and extract the zip then run `npm install` followed by `bower install` (assuming you have npm and bower installed on your machine). This will download all of FRNT's required dependencies.

Once this has finished run `grunt` to watch for and compile any changes you make.
